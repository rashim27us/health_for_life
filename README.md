# Health for Life - Secure EHR Management on Blockchain

## Overview

Health for Life is a revolutionary Personal Health Record (PHR) system that addresses the challenges posed by traditional electronic health records (EHRs) in terms of interoperability and data privacy. Leveraging blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Health for Life provides individuals with a patient-centric platform to securely manage, share, and aggregate their health data across various healthcare institutions.

## Problem Statement

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have improved healthcare efficiency, security, and data redundancy reduction compared to paper-based systems. However, challenges such as data interoperability and patient privacy persist. The Government of India's attempt to establish the National Digital Health Mission (NHDM) highlights the need for standardized interoperability. Blockchain, with its encrypted data blocks and distributed ledger design, offers a promising solution to enhance EHRs by ensuring interoperability and data privacy.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized EHR Management:** Harness blockchain and IPFS to create a decentralized ecosystem for storing and managing Electronic Health Records. This ensures data integrity, tamper resistance, and high availability.

- **Patient Empowerment:** Health for Life empowers patients to oversee their health records across multiple healthcare providers. This user-centric approach grants patients control over who accesses their sensitive medical information.

- **Enhanced Privacy:** By employing robust encryption and cryptographic techniques, Health for Life ensures patient privacy. Only authorized individuals, as determined by the patient, can access their health data.

- **Secure Data Sharing:** Seamlessly share health records with healthcare professionals, improving diagnosis accuracy and treatment efficiency, while adhering to stringent privacy and security standards.

- **Blockchain Integration:** Integrate Health for Life with the blockchain infrastructure and the Health Stack, utilizing Abha ID and Aadhar for identity management.

- **Efficient Search and Identification:** Utilize advanced search capabilities to quickly locate relevant documents based on various parameters, including date, doctor, document type, hospital name, and patient name.

- **Flexible Document Sharing:** Health for Life supports sharing documents in various formats, such as images and PDFs.

- **PHR Digitization:** Transition from paper-based records to digital records with the ability to digitize PHR documents.
